The George Washington Bridge is a double-decked suspension bridge that spans the Hudson River, connecting the boroughs of Manhattan and New Jersey in New York City. The bridge was completed in 1931 and was the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time, with a main span of 3,500 feet (1,067 meters). It was named after George Washington, the first President of the United States and commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.

The construction of the George Washington Bridge was a monumental feat of engineering and required years of planning and hard work. It was designed by engineer Othmar Ammann, who also designed the Bayonne Bridge and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. The bridge's construction also had a significant impact on the development of New York City, as it made it easier for people to travel between Manhattan and New Jersey and helped to spur economic growth in the surrounding areas. Today, the George Washington Bridge is an important transportation link for commuters and travelers in New York City, and it remains a symbol of the city's innovation and progress.
