The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge is an iconic suspension bridge that spans the Narrows, the tidal strait separating Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York City. The bridge was named after the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, who sailed into New York Harbor in 1524. The idea for the bridge was first proposed in the 1920s, but it wasn't until the late 1940s that the project gained traction. Construction began in August 1959, and the bridge opened to traffic on November 21, 1964. At the time, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world, with a main span of 4,260 feet (1,298 meters).

The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge quickly became a symbol of New York City, appearing in countless films, TV shows, and photographs. It also played a vital role in the city's transportation infrastructure, providing a direct connection between Staten Island and Brooklyn, as well as a link to the rest of New York City. The bridge has undergone several renovations and upgrades over the years, including the addition of a bike and pedestrian path in 2019. Today, it remains a beloved landmark and an engineering marvel, attracting visitors and commuters alike from around the world.
