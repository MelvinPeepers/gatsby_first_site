The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge is a double-decked suspension bridge that connects the boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York City. The bridge was completed in 1964 and was the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time, with a main span of 4,260 feet (1,298 meters). It was named after the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, who was the first European to enter New York Harbor in 1524.

The construction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge was a massive engineering project that required years of planning and hard work. The bridge was designed by engineer Othmar Ammann, who also designed the George Washington Bridge and the Bayonne Bridge. The construction of the bridge was also controversial, as it required the demolition of several historic homes and buildings in the surrounding areas. Today, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge is an important transportation link for commuters and travelers in New York City, and it remains a symbol of the city's innovation and progress.
