The Goethals Bridge is a significant suspension bridge located in the New York metropolitan area. The bridge was named after Major General George W. Goethals, who oversaw the construction of the Panama Canal and served as the first consulting engineer of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The bridge was built to connect Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Staten Island, New York, and was opened to traffic on June 29, 1928. It was the first bridge to be built by the Port Authority, which was established in 1921. The Goethals Bridge was designed by Cass Gilbert, who also designed the Woolworth Building in New York City, and was constructed by the American Bridge Company. It was the longest suspension bridge in the world when it was completed, with a total length of 7,109 feet.

Over the years, the Goethals Bridge has undergone numerous renovations and upgrades to keep up with the increasing demand for transportation. In 2013, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced plans to replace the original Goethals Bridge with a new state-of-the-art bridge. The new bridge was built adjacent to the original bridge and was opened to traffic on May 16, 2018. The new Goethals Bridge features wider lanes, improved safety features, and modern technology. It also incorporates environmentally sustainable features, such as LED lighting and a permeable concrete pavement. The original Goethals Bridge has since been demolished, marking the end of an era for one of the most iconic suspension bridges in the New York metropolitan area.
